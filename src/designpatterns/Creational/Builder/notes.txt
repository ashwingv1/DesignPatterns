Builder pattern is used to build the objects of below scenarios
    1. when we have lot of attributes - it avoids constructor telescopping when we have some optional attributes
    2. need to perform validations of attributes of the object, we can do it either from builder.build() method or inside constructor of object.
    3. When we have number of complex steps to create an object. builder class can tak care of it.
    4. Builder provides atomicity while building an object
    5. Builder supports method chaining thus provides readability in the code
