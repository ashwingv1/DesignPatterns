Abstract factory design pattern is similar to factory design pattern.
We use this when we create objects of different sub groups.
For example we need to create object of items and item is devided into Stationary item and Hardware item.
Here We will have a Interface and implmenting factory classes.
Factory object will be created in run time depending on need.

In factory method we use a static method called create, but here we use normal method thus creating object of factory is mandatory to create actual objects.
