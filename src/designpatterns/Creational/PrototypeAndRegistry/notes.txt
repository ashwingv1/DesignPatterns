When we have objects which needs to be cloned frequently, we can use prototype design pattern.
Here we support clone method in class of object. We can also have a prototype and cone the prototype to create each object when most of the attributes are same with minimal change.

When we need to store multiple prototypes and use them in runtime based on need, we can use registry design pattern.
It's uses prototype pattern and a registry class in addition. Registry classes stores prototype objects of different types.
